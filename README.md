# Luke's Store

Live Preview: 

This app is basically just your average online store. You can add/subtract items to cart while the total will dynamically update. Also if you have duplicate items in your cart it won't render the item twice, but instead will increase the quantity of the item in your cart. 

While making this app, I wanted to get good practice using the React Testing Library to make sure the user interface is working as planned. Along with that, I also wanted to brush up on how to route components in React.
